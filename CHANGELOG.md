# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Source-owned, one-attempt Chrome reconnect on the exact cached-browser unavailable error only; working or empty tabs, timeouts, stale tabs and denial do not reselect. One real recovery was followed by a successful source-owned read of the original target, without clearing claims or resending.
- Exact-URL reuse for target-only intake: uniquely matching existing tabs are read and retained, absent targets use an owned temporary tab, and ambiguous or drifting handles fail closed. Send/reconciliation tab lifecycles are unchanged.
- A separate strict Threads semantic-SVG reply-icon node binder with hidden/mixed text, multiple-icon, label, identity-collision and drift regressions. Generic and Instagram text identity behavior is unchanged; the helper cannot click or authorize a send.
- Facebook exact-native target reader with whole-body/emoji extraction, observed author checks, positive own-child detection, URL/account continuity and anonymous DOM-parser regressions. After exact-tab reuse was added, one real source-owned double-read reached the private canonical ledger. Whole-post/reply-thread completeness and Facebook sending remain unverified.
- Exact Threads root/target ID, same-host and query-free URL guards; reject self-root, child paths, duplicate/conflicting identifiers and false observed-parent URLs.
- Threads source-owned native target reader with explicit root/focus context, whole-body extraction and account/URL continuity. One real target-only observation reached the private canonical ledger; anonymous DOM regressions cover wrong parent, truncation, loading and identity drift. Zero-reply UI remains non-authoritative for sending.
- Source-owned, single-action Instagram canary and read-only recovery: one real reply was independently observed and its original attempt reconciled as sent without resubmission. Private reply data is excluded from this repository.
- Canonical post-analysis fields for exact caption/hash, deterministic length, layout and black-card properties, keywords/entities/numeric language, voice/CTA, Unicode punctuation, exact date/weekday/minute/daypart, outcome qualifiers and cross-surface conflicts.
- A digest-based `coverage` gate proving every eligible post reaches the P0/P2 feature matrix, with an independent exact-compare dimension for every applicable extended analytics subtree and no private caption/path exposure in the audit receipt.
- Mandatory canonical comparables/context consumption before planning and drafting, with exact platform/maturity/content-type/surface cohorts and non-causal timing treatment.
- Product-native JavaScript architecture gate with an exact module-role manifest, measured internal static edges, one exact reviewed external lazy dependency, cycle detection, required-edge checks and atomic receipt plus detached hash evidence.
- Eighty calibrated architecture checks covering the exact browser-client source/specifier/kind/cardinality boundary, eager or drifted imports, graph-digest coverage, template-expression parsing, common loader aliases and member calls, inventory drift, role boundaries, receipt path safety and atomic-write failure cases.
- Explicit internal obligations for a trusted Chrome host resolver and stable node/frame mapping before any authenticated browser canary.

### Changed

- Split long scan/send/domain contracts and platform readers into focused modules while preserving prior exports and guards. Bind every extracted authority dependency into canary and promotion source inventories.
- Separate pure document checks from runtime authority and DOM-CUA node identity from send-policy/context validation, preserving prior exports and exact source-hash inventories. No length threshold or exception was added for these changes.
- Split surface/textarea tests and move the reinspection JSON example into the validation reference without changing its fields. Live adapter candidate revision is `2026-08-31.6`; runtime authority revision is `2026-08-31.2`.
- Split the actuator test suite into focused modules and froze the 22-case runner manifest, names and execution order.
- Split send orchestration from reusable send support while preserving fail-closed claim, reply-exhaustion, reconciliation and recovery behavior.
- Added post-navigation fixture readiness checks for exact loopback URL, runtime identity, platform/account/post binding and exactly two visible targets.
- Fixed contenteditable composer readback, cross-realm submit receipts, Threads reply IDs and explicit `test_only` attempt evidence.
- Stripped private evidence paths from generation context while preserving measurements, and blocked public sync when private path patterns remain.
- Changed screenshot provenance from order-dependent digests to an exact path-to-SHA-256 manifest in the private ledger; path and digest data remain outside the public export and generation context.
- Pinned browser-client revision, size and SHA-256 before dynamic import, with missing or drifted runtime bytes failing closed.
- Reclassified the four browser/live canary obligations as `unmeasured` until their internal host prerequisites and real evidence exist.

### Boundary

- The three-platform Browser journey passed only against localhost fixtures with in-memory test authority. A separate single-action Instagram canary was sent and reconciled; Facebook and Threads sending remain unverified. `capability_promotion_eligible` and `live_browser_actuation_enabled` remain `false`; the production prerequisites and bounded batch automation remain open. No new stable release or capability promotion is implied by this candidate.

## v2.5.0 — 2026-08-28

### Added

- Reusable live-DOM Chrome actuator with `scanPost`, `prepareReply`, `submitOnce`, `inspectResult` and `reinspect` interfaces.
- Split actuator facade into scan, send, shared evidence, and durable Python-ledger claim modules.
- Interactive Facebook, Instagram and Threads localhost fixtures plus a Browser Plugin E2E driver.
- Durable `browser_scan_completed` events, including zero-result and thread-expansion evidence.
- Closed-world comment capability ledger and calibrated negative gate.
- Default-deny live browser policy gate with byte-identical no-mutation regressions for scan, begin, finish and reconcile.

### Changed

- A same-session, same-scope `needs_reconcile` intent now blocks later browser actions and preflights until reconciliation.
- Approved reply text is SHA-256 checked and preparation binds canonical action, fresh locator plan, strong parent anchor, parent-scoped controls, and a zero exact-own baseline.
- Bare `WRITE_OK` was replaced by an atomic, structured `SUBMIT_CLAIM`; process-wide reservation plus append-only ledger state block concurrency, actor recreation, and cross-process replay.
- Post-submit success requires a fully expanded and inspectable reply set, exactly one new own-account exact reply under the verified parent, and a total reply count at least one above the persisted pre-submit baseline. Count regression or equal-total replacement remains uncertain.
- Test-only receipts, URL credentials, non-default ports, alternate origins, mutable expected evidence, hidden/malformed replies, and pre-existing duplicates now fail closed.
- Comment self-tests now include the JavaScript actuator contract when Node is available.

### Boundary

- Contract and pure-Node tests are verified. Release policy ships with `live_browser_actuation_enabled:false`; real Browser Plugin fixture journeys, trusted platform adapters and authenticated FB／IG／Threads canaries remain explicitly `blocked_external`. Live actuation must not be enabled until receipt provenance, locator attestation and same-node click guards are implemented and validated.

## v2.4.0 — 2026-08-28

### Added

- Executable structured Chrome bridge commands: `browser-scan-request`, `browser-scan`, `browser-action`, `browser-begin`, `browser-finish` and `browser-reconcile`.
- Append-only, expiring scan-target requests that bind live observations to an independently selected session, account and post.
- Strict action／preflight／receipt binding across permit, session, scope, comment fingerprint and exact reply hash.
- Freshness, integer schema, exact post path／query, composer readback and post-submit causality guards.
- Facebook, Instagram and Threads local HTML contract fixtures plus state-derived fill／click receipts, verified, ambiguous, stale, wrong-parent, wrong-type and reconciliation journeys.
- Credential-shaped public-sync negative controls and explicit browser evidence／trace privacy exclusions.

### Changed

- Active skill ledgers reject raw begin／finish／reconcile commands that bypass the Chrome bridge; those commands remain available only for isolated fixture ledgers.
- A contradictory or partially verified submit can no longer become `sent_verified`; it remains `needs_reconcile` and cannot be blindly retried.
- Reinspection now uses a structured receipt. Uncertain reinspection performs no ledger mutation.
- Preflight evidence must occur after approval and before permit expiry; a failed outcome cannot contradict visible own-reply evidence.

### Boundary

- The bridge prevents accidental stale, cross-post and duplicate actions, but browser observations remain trusted assertions from the current bound Codex Chrome session rather than cryptographic DOM attestation.

## v2.3.0 — 2026-08-28

### Added

- P5 Chrome Comment Ops for Facebook, Instagram and Threads without Meta API integration.
- Append-only comment observations and reply audit state machine.
- Strong／weak comment identity, stale-draft detection, bounded-auto policy and repeated-reply gate.
- One-shot permits scoped to session, platform, account, post, comment and exact reply hash.
- Append-only bounded-auto session grants with exact scope, expiry, revocation and a cumulative action cap.
- `send_started → sent_verified／needs_reconcile` recovery so uncertain browser outcomes are never blindly retried.
- Behavioral tests for cross-platform identity, authorization, idempotency, uncertain sends, optimistic concurrency and dry-run writes.

### Changed

- Public sync is now a closed-world allowlist: new private files are excluded unless explicitly approved.
- Live comment actions use current-session authorization and a finite run cap; private messages and media replies remain out of scope.

### Privacy

- Real comments, replies, authors, post IDs, browser sessions, cookies, tokens, screenshots and local account data are excluded from the public package.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-08-24

### Added

- Append-only factual correction events.
- Machine-readable measurement precision qualifiers.
- Privacy-blocking public sync preflight and managed-file manifest.
- Anonymous public rule／formula starter library and fictional case fixture.

### Changed

- Summary output now displays non-exact play counts with their qualifier.
- Current public tree no longer ships private account cases, outcome archives, personal voice evidence or account-specific platform policy.

### Validation

- Added positive correction materialization, immutable-source, illegal identity mutation, qualifier propagation and privacy preflight tests.

## v2.1.1 — 2026-08-13

- Added account-period snapshots with the same revision, lock and atomic commit path as post outcomes.

## v2.1.0 — 2026-08-13

- Split storage, validation, application and CLI responsibilities.
- Added progressive-disclosure context routes, append-only experiment revisions and config-driven public sync.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-08-11

- Introduced P3 outcome logging, P4 pattern optimization and structured JSONL stores.
